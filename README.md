<h2>Minor Third</h2>
<p><strong>Incrementation of 1.200</strong><p>
<p>I normally use Minor Third to most of my website projects. Especially if they are catered to the public. The headings are easy on the eyes and can easily be distinguished. Best used for compacted websites.</p>

<h2>Major Third</h2>
<p><strong>Incrementation of 1.250</strong><p>
<p>Major Third is used when the font used gives an illusion of being small, which might be hard to distinguished by most people.</p>

<h2>Perfect Fourth</h2>
<p><strong>Incrementation of 1.333</strong><p>
<p>Visually larger than Minor Third and ideal for websites with noticeable whitespaces. A nice Jumbotron Heading and caption combination for compacted websites. Take note when I say compact websites, <strong>Minor Third</strong> is my choice for the Body Headings.</p>

<h2>Augmented Fourth</h2>
<p><strong>Incrementation of 1.414</strong><p>
<p>My favorite for websites that are full of whitespaces and normally focused on typography and big photographs. Not advisable to compact websites. This should'nt be used for websites intended for mainstream viewing. You know those websites like Facebook, Government websites, Gmail, etc. Large fonts tend to intimidate most people. It comes out to strong which makes people uneasy. But if used correctly with whitespaces and really minimal text contents, it looks really pretty.</p>
